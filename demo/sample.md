An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that (not considering the asterisk) the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,

An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    // A little loop.
    For i As Integer = 0 To 10
      MsgBox(Str(i))
    Next i

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
Dim f As Xojo.IO.FolderItem
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for syntax highlighters:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
```

Note how I used ` ``` ` to fence out the code block instead of `~~~`. Either works fine. Flanking text between backticks results in a `code span`.


### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, e.g: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.

You can use valid HTML entity references inline: &amp;, &copy;, &ouml;. This includes decimal character references (&#1234;) and hexadecimal references (&#xcab;).

Raw HTML can be included as a block:

<aside>
<p>Some Text</p>
</aside>

And inline <del>like this</del>
